# SpirrwellStringLibrary
This is C++17 string library made by me, for me.

The goal of this is a simple string class that has easy to use helper functions like .upper(), .split(), or .reverse().

It's not the most optimized library. There's duplicate code! I include \<algorithm\>! It does not support allocators! It is not BLAZING fast!

BUT it is fairly easy to use and is quite interoperable with std::string and std::string_view with some separate helper functions just for those.
